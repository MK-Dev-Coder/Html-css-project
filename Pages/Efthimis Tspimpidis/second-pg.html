      <h1>Guerrilla Warfare</h1>
      <article>
      <p>The use of hit-and-run tactics was a key component of the guerrilla warfare tactics used by the Continental Army. This strategy involved attacking the British forces and then quickly retreating, avoiding direct confrontation and making it difficult for the British to effectively engage the Continental Army <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>. The use of hit-and-run tactics allowed the Continental Army to continuously harass the British forces, wearing them down over time.</p>
      <p>Another important aspect of the guerrilla warfare tactics used by the Continental Army was speed and mobility. The Continental Army was able to move quickly and strike quickly, making it difficult for the British to respond effectively. The use of speed and mobility allowed the Continental Army to take advantage of the local terrain and strike at the British when they were least expecting it.</p>
      <p>Lastly, the use of local terrain was another key aspect of the guerrilla warfare tactics used by the Continental Army. The Continental Army knew the local terrain well and used it to their advantage, launching surprise attacks on the British forces in areas where they were not expecting it. They used the local terrain to conceal their movements and launch surprise attacks on the British.</p>

<title>Conventional Warfare Strategies</title>

<div class ="text-box-for-strategies">
<h1>Conventional Warfare Strategies</h1>
<article id="strategies">
  <p>One of the key strategies used by the British Army was the use of large, organized forces. The British had a significant advantage in terms of numbers and resources, and they used these advantages to their advantage by organizing large, well-trained and equipped forces to engage the Continental Army <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>. The British Army's use of large, organized forces allowed them to engage the Continental Army in traditional, large-scale battles.</p>
  <p>Another key strategy used by the British Army was the use of artillery and other heavy weapons. The British Army had a significant advantage in terms of artillery and other heavy weapons and used them to their advantage by bombarding the Continental Army's fortifications and positions. The use of artillery and other heavy weapons allowed the British Army to break the Continental Army's defenses and engage them in close combat.</p>
  <p>The British Army also relied on naval power as a key strategy, which allowed them to control the coast and waterways, and use them to move troops and supplies. This strategy enabled them to launch amphibious assaults, and naval blockades and control the seas and waterways.</p>

<title>The Role Of Navy</title>

    <h1>The Role Of Navy</h1>
    <article>
    <p>One of the key strategies used by the British Navy was the use of naval blockades. The British Navy established naval blockades along the coast of the colonies, which served to cut off supplies and communication between the colonies, making it difficult for the Continental Army to operate effectively. This strategy played a significant role in the British Army's early successes, such as the capture of New York City <a href="#ref3">[3]</a>.</p>
    <p>Another key strategy used by the British Navy was the use of amphibious assaults. The British Navy used their naval power to launch amphibious assaults on key coastal cities and ports, such as Charleston and Savannah, which allowed the British Army to gain control of key locations and resources.</p>
    <p>The Continental Navy, on the other hand, was less developed and had fewer resources, but they still played a significant role in the war effort. The Continental Navy focused on hit-and-run tactics and privateers, which helped to disrupt the British merchant fleet, and made it harder for the British to move troops and supplies. Additionally, the Continental Navy helped to protect American coastal towns and ports from the British Navy.</p>

  <h1>Key Battles</h1>
  <article id="key">
    <p>One of the key battles of the war was the Battle of Lexington and Concord. This battle, which took place on April 19, 1775, marked the beginning of the war and was the first military engagement between the Continental Army and the British Army. The battle was shaped by the strategies and tactics used by both sides, with the Continental Army using hit-and-run tactics and the British Army using a conventional warfare approach. The battle ultimately ended in a tactical victory for the Continental Army, but it was a significant morale boost and was instrumental in the formation of the Continental Army. <a href="#ref4">[4]</a></p>
    <p>Another key battle of the war was the Battle of Saratoga, which took place in September and October of 1777. This battle was a major turning point in the war and was shaped by the strategies and tactics used by both sides. The Continental Army, under the command of General Horatio Gates, used guerrilla warfare tactics and the use of local terrain to their advantage, while the British Army, under the command of General John Burgoyne, used a conventional warfare approach. The Battle of Saratoga ultimately ended in a decisive victory for the Continental Army, which was a significant morale boost and helped to secure foreign support for the Continental Army.<a href="#ref5"></a>[5]</p>
