            <article>
            <p>The American Revolution had a profound and lasting impact on the formation of the United States government. One of the most significant long-term effects of the war was the drafting and ratification of the United States Constitution. The Constitution, which was written in 1787 and ratified in 1788, established the framework for the federal government of the United States and the separation of powers between the legislative, executive, and judicial branches<a href="#ref1">[1]</a>.</p>
            <p>The Constitution also provided for a system of checks and balances to prevent any one branch of government from gaining too much power, and it established the Bill of Rights to protect individual rights and liberties <a href="#ref2">[2]</a>. The Constitution is widely considered to be one of the most important and influential documents in history and it has served as a model for many other nations' constitutions[3]<a href="#ref3">[3]</a>.</p>
            <p> In addition, the American Revolution also established the principle that government should be based on the consent of the governed, a principle that has been a cornerstone of democracy throughout the world [4]. The revolutionary ideals of liberty, self-government, and individual rights that inspired the colonies to break away from Britain spread quickly to other parts of the world and continue to inspire people to this day<a href="#ref4">[4]</a>.</p>

      <h1>Development</h1>
      <article id="development">
        <p>The American Revolutionary War had a significant impact on the economic and social development of the United States. The war disrupted trade and commerce, as the British navy imposed blockades on American ports and American merchants struggled to find new markets for their goods <a href="#ref5">[5]</a>. Additionally, the war caused inflation and a shortage of currency, which made it difficult for farmers and merchants to conduct business <a href="#ref6">[6]</a>.</p>
        <p>However, the war also led to some positive economic changes. The demand for goods and services increased as the Continental Army needed supplies, which allowed some businesses to flourish <a href="#ref7">[7]</a>. The war also led to the development of new industries, such as shipbuilding and arms manufacturing <a href="#ref8">[8]</a>.</p>

          <h1>Impact Around The World</h1>
          <article>
          <p>The American Revolutionary War had a significant impact on the international community, as it marked the first successful war of independence against a colonial power. The ideals of freedom and self-government that drove the American Revolution spread around the world, inspiring other colonies and oppressed peoples to fight for their own independence<a href="#ref9">[9]</a> </p>
          <p>The war also marked the rise of the United States as a global power. The success of the revolution solidified the country's status as a major player on the international stage, and the country's newfound independence allowed it to establish its own foreign policies and alliances<a href="#ref10">[10]</a>.</p>

        <h1>Legacy And Memory</h1>
        <article id="legacy">
          <p>The American Revolutionary War, fought between 1765 and 1783, was a defining moment in American history. The war resulted in the colonies' victory over British rule and the establishment of the United States as a new nation. The legacy and memory of the war continue to shape the United States in various ways today.</p>
          <p>One way that the war is remembered is through the celebration of patriotic holidays, such as Independence Day. The Fourth of July is a national holiday in the United States, celebrated with parades, speeches, and fireworks to commemorate the signing of the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. Additionally, many states and municipalities hold annual reenactments of key battles of the war, such as Lexington and Concord, Saratoga, and Yorktown, to commemorate the sacrifices of the soldiers who fought in the war.</p>
          <p>Another way that the war is remembered is through its inclusion in American education. The American Revolutionary War is a significant part of American history, and it is taught in schools and universities throughout the United States. The war is often studied in American history classes, and it is also covered in American literature classes, as the war was a major influence on American writers such as Thomas Paine and Thomas Jefferson.</p>
